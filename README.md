# Game Description

Don't Die is a web game, currently only work on computers, and displays best on Google Chrome.
Technologies used - HTML, Canvas, JavaScript and CSS
The game started as something quite different, but in the process of the developing, it took a turn and then became it's own thing.
The approach was to have a player controled element, that would explore around the screen, collect items and avoid obstacles.
Then we decided on making the obstacles mobile to increase the difficuty of the game.

The game has three difficulty modes, in each mode the bombs drop in a faster speed.

# Installation instructions
open the link and enjoy the game :)

# Future updates

in a future update we will enable an option to increase the speed of the bomb spawning, to increase diffuculty.

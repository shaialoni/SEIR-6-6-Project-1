# SEIR-6-6-Project-1

# Your app must:

Display a game in the browser
Switch turns between two players, or have the user play the computer (AI or obstacles)
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it**
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

# Necessary Deliverables

A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

# Suggested Ways to Get Started

Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
Commit early, commit often. Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
Consult documentation resources (MDN, etc.) to better understand what you'll be getting into.
Don't be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you're trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven't solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

# game idea - super mario style scroller game

2d third person style game where character goes on an adventure and is able to explore the playing field, collect items and encounter random computer generated characters.

games goal - collect enough items

# user experience - 
(Music??? Sound effects???)
the game starts with player selection - user get's to pick a character. (two characters available)

At game start, character diplays on a screen with basic landscape in the background.
character can move around the screen and the screen scrolls as the character advances. once the screen scroll, there is no going back.

different platforms will become available as the landscape scrolls, with different items displaying on the different platforms. some items will increase your score (coins, food, etc), and some items will decrease your score (spiky things, bombs, etc).

game goal - reach the pre determined score to win. game can also end if the score (separate health measurement?) reaches zero.
